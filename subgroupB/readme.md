# Singapore Office Carbon Emissions Calculator
## Overview
### This project is a web application designed to calculate and visualize carbon emissions for office buildings in Singapore. It includes two calculators:
* Standardized Calculator: Calculates total carbon emissions based on user inputs.
* Prediction Calculator: Predicts emissions using a machine learning model.
Users can input data manually or upload CSV files. The results include total emissions, data visualizations comparing emissions to industry averages, and a personalized report generated by OpenAI’s API.

## Display Adaptation (1080p)
This application has been designed to deliver the best visual and interactive experience on \*\*24\-inch displays with 1080p resolution\*\*. To ensure compatibility:
* Target Resolution: 1920×1080 (Full HD).
* Scaling Recommendations: Adjust the browser’s zoom level based on your display settings:
  * For a 24\-inch monitor: Use a zoom level of 100%.
  * For smaller screens or higher resolutions: Adjust the zoom level to fit the layout properly.
* For unsupported resolutions or devices, resizing or scaling the browser window may help achieve better compatibility.

## Technologies Used
### Frontend
* HTML: index.html
* CSS: index.css
* JavaScript: script.js
* Visualization Tool: Chart.js

### Backend
* OpenAI API: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions, used for generating personalized reports.
* Local Machine Learning API: After installing Flask and Flask\-CORS, the API can be started from the 5105 ml directory by running python app.py in the terminal. The app.py script processes the best rf model.pkl file, converting it into a JSON format readable by JavaScript for frontend integration.

## Setup Instructions
### Important Notes
Due to differences in screen resolution and scaling settings across devices, users may need to manually adjust the browser zoom level for optimal display. For a 24\-inch 1080p monitor, a zoom level of 90% is recommended.

### Frontend
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone  cd 
2. Open the index.html file in a browser.

### Backend API
1. Navigate to the 5105 ml folder.
2. Install required dependencies:
    pip install flask
    pip install flask\-cors
3. Start the local API server:
    python app.py
4. Ensure the best rf model.pkl file is in the same directory as app.py.

### Connecting Frontend and Backend
Update the API endpoint in script.js to match the local backend server, e.g., http://127\.0\.0\.1:5000

## How to Use
1. Input data manually or upload a CSV file.
2. View the results:
   * Total carbon emissions.
   * Visualizations comparing emissions to industry averages.
3. Generate a personalized report based on user data and emissions results.
